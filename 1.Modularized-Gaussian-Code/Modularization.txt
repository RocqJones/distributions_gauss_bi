Look at how the Distribution class and Gaussian class are modularized into different files. 

The Gaussiandistribution.py imports Distribution class from the Generaldistribution.py file. 
The line of code:

from Generaldistribution import Distribution

essentially pastes the Distribution code to the top of the Gaussiandistribution file when you run the 
code. You'll see in the example_code.py file an example of how to use the Gaussian class.

The example_code.py file then imports the Gaussian distribution class.
