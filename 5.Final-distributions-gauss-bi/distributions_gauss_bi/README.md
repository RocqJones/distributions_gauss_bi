# Gaussian and Binomial distributions

## Gaussian distribution (also known as **normal distribution).
* In probability theory, a normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is The parameter is the mean or expectation of the distribution; and is its standard deviation.

## Binomial distribution.
* In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: success/yes/true/one (with probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability q = 1 − p).
